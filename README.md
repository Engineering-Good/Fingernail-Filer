This ergonomically designed device allows user's hands to be stabilized comfortably. This would enable the user to easily place their fingers into the slot to be trimmed. Inside the slot, there will be sandpaper attached to the disc which is connected to a motor. The rotational motion will trim away the finger nail when it touches. A powerbank can be used to power this device, making it portable.
